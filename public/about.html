            <h3 class="infobody">Movie Finder is a project started to help people de-Google their lives. One of the many genuinely useful features of the Google search engine is that upon searching for a piece of media, you can find where to watch it on the front page. However, many alternative search engines do not have the feature. This is where Movie Finder comes in, as I aim for this to be a convenient location to find what options you have to consume virtually any content.</h3>

            <h3 class="infobody">If you want to find/host the project yourself, navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/Nyxterius/MovieFinder/tree/main">Github</a> and follow the instructions therein to deploy it using Nodejs.</h3>
